  {\bf An Interesting Title}
\end{center}

The objective of this proposal is to assemble new mathematical models
and computational tools to characterize how laser beams interact with
turbulent environments. The main questions of interest include
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How can PDEs such as the PWE be accurately and efficiently
    solved?

  \item How does turbulence and bathymetry affect the laser beams?

\end{enumerate}
