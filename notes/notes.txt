Jan 9: Meeting with Reza Malek-Madani and Nick Moore to discuss PWE
project for Navy.

Questions for Reza:
  1. What are the goals for the project?
      - A PDE model with a solver for PWEs? This is the one Reza is
        interested in. Also in multiscale/multiphysics type problems
      - AI/ML tools
  2. What would technology transfer look like?
      - Not needed for Reza's program. His program is about fundamental
        research. Deliverables is talks and peer-reviewed papers.
  3. Term of the project? 3 years?
      - 3 years is correct
  4. Do we need a F2F meeting in the next few weeks/months?
  5. What are our next steps for a submission?
      - Write a white paper. Include a budget. White paper by the end of
        February. Feedback at end of March. Proposal in April. Start in
        September.
      - At most 2 page white paper, budget, and short CV. Pay lipservice
        to the application. Underwater communication is the big one.
        All we need to do is reference it.
      - Needs to be clear very early in the white paper what the
        application is.
      - Choose the smallest non-trivial problem to work on.

How laser beams interact with a turbulent environment using techniques
from Mathematicians instead of Engineers.

One person working on the project is working at NRL at a large laser
lab. (Avramov)

Would like to see connections between PWE and non-linear Schrodinger

Look for author with last name Judd that is in the Avramov papers (these
are all in the google drive). He is the right person

If we do ML/AI, then it needs to be connected back to the physics, PDE,
but shouldn't just be a data-type research.

Need to dig much deeper into literature to look at Schrodinger equation.

Can request funds if we could benefit from it.
